 ","Job description About Us: Turing is one of the world’s fastest-growing AI companies, pushing the boundaries of AI-assisted software development. Our mission is to empower the next generation of AI systems to reason about and work with real-world software repositories. You’ll be working at the intersection of software engineering, open-source ecosystems, and frontier AI. Project Overview: We're building high-quality evaluation and training datasets to improve how Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with realistic software engineering tasks. A key focus of this project is curating verifiable software engineering challenges from public GitHub repository histories using a human-in-the-loop process. Why This Role Is Unique: - Collaborate directly with AI researchers shaping the future of AI-powered software development. - Work with high-impact open-source projects and evaluate how LLMs perform on real bugs, issues, and developer tasks. - Influence dataset design that will train and benchmark next-gen LLMs. What does day-to-day look like: - Review and compare 3–4 model-generated code responses for each task using a structured ranking system. - Evaluate code diffs for correctness, code quality, style, and efficiency. - Provide clear, detailed rationales explaining the reasoning behind each ranking decision. - Maintain high consistency and objectivity across evaluations. - Collaborate with the team to identify edge cases and ambiguities in model behavior. Required Skills: - At least 3 years of experience at top-tier product or research companies (e.g., Stripe, Datadog, Snowflake, Dropbox, Canva, Shopify, Intuit, PayPal, or research roles at IBM, GE, Honeywell, Schneider, etc.), with a total of 7+ years of overall professional software engineering experience. - Strong fundamentals in software design, coding best practices, and debugging. - Excellent ability to assess code quality, correctness, and maintainability. - Proficient with code review processes and reading diffs in real-world repositories. - Exceptional written communication skills to articulate evaluation rationale clearly. - Prior experience with LLM-generated code or evaluation work is a plus. Bonus Points: - Experience in LLM research, developer agents, or AI evaluation projects. - Background in building or scaling developer tools or automation systems. Engagement Details: - Commitment: ~20 hours/week (partial PST overlap required) - Type: Contractor (no medical/paid leave) - Duration: 1 month (starting next week; potential extensions based on performance and fit) - Rates: $40–$100/hour, based on experience and skill level.",https://in.jobrapido.com/jobpreview/1089047880557133824?utm_source=bingjobs&trk=bingjobs
